  "description": "The Migration Wizard launched after Employee Central login needs UX improvements:\n\n1. **Add Skip Button** - Users should be able to skip the Migration Wizard and proceed directly to their destination\n\n2. **Conditional Launch** - Migration Wizard should NOT launch when logging in via Employee Central (platform=aeims). It should only launch for migration-specific login flows.",
